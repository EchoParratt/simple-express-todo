# Todo List API

## Description
This project is a simple Todo List API built using Node.js and Express. It allows users to create, retrieve, and delete todo items from an in-memory store. 
The application provides a basic RESTful API with support for adding new tasks, viewing all tasks, and removing tasks based on their ID.

## Goals
Add a working frontend first using the template HTML, then eventually shift it over into Typescript using the React framework
